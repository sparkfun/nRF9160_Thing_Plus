SparkFun has paired up with CircuitDojo to bring you the SparkFun nRF9160 Thing Plus, which features the powerful Nordic nRF9160 microcontroller in a feather-compatible footprint. This little chip is capable of both CAT M1 LTE and NB-IoT cellular communication and is designed to work with Zephyr, the go-to RTOS for embedded development.

Not only can you take advantage of Nordic’s advanced power states, but you can also put the device into a low power standby state. Laboratory measurements are putting that mode at about 2µA of current. 2µA! It also features a 3.3V Buck-Boost which helps get every mWh from your batteries as possible.

No batteries? No problem! You can plug or power your nRF9160 Thing Plus externally for AC/DC powered operation. Keep it on at all times for high availability scenarios. Power it the 5V pin or insert a micro-USB cable to keep things going.

Want to persist data? The nRF9160 Thing Plus has a 4MB external flash for storing data while offline. Using external flash with a filesystem like LitteFS and you’ll have a project to recon with!
